Python implementation of the ensemble for land use change detection using  satellite images. The ensemble is based on three fundamentally different approaches for detecting changes. Python codes were scaled using python multiprocessing (across cores)
and pyparallel (across nodes).

A high performance parallel version of the approach, scaled using openmp, was implemented as well (mpi based scaling in progress). These codes are available on request.
