Python implementation of my thesis on ensemble method
for land change detection using  satellite images. 
The ensemble is based upon three principally different 
approaches for detecting changes. 
Python codes were scaled using python multiprocessing (across cores)
and pyparallel (across nodes).

A high performance parallel version of the 
approach, scaled using openmp, was implemented as well (mpi based scaling in progress).
These codes are available upon request.
